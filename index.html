			About me

			<p>
				Hi, my name is Victor! I am a 4th year student studying at the University of British Columbia, and 
				 I am currently pursuing a Combined Degree in Microbiology and Computer Science. When I started my studies 
				 at UBC, I initially planned to enroll in the UBC Pharmacy Program and establish a career in the pharmaceutical industry. 
				 Back then, I was driven with the sole purpose of making everyday life easier for people through ease of access to
				 professional help. However, upon the completion of my 2nd year of UBC, I started to develop a passion for the fun, dynamic and technological
				 world of computer science! I was drawn to computer science because I felt the skills I would learn would better help me achieve my goal 
				 of making life easier for people of all backgrounds. In addition, computer science reignited another interest of mine which is to create. 
				 For these reasons, I chose to make the transition and now here I am (plus with my own website)!
